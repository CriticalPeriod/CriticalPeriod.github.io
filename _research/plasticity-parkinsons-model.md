## Summary

Building on critical period biology, we developed a Parkinson's disease model to test whether modulating neural plasticity could serve as a therapeutic strategy for circuit rewiring in the adult brain. The rationale is that reopening windows of heightened plasticity might allow damaged circuits to reorganize and partially restore function.

Our results are encouraging: plasticity modulation led to measurable improvements in circuit function, suggesting that strategies derived from developmental neuroscience could complement existing therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

## Key findings

- Cortical plasticity enhancing strategies can be applied to non-cortical lesions model
- Measurable circuit improvements following plasticity modulation
- Complementary approach to existing Parkinson's therapies
